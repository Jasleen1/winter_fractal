This repository contains code for an implementation of fractal, based on 
https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1076 .
Various branches of the repository https://github.com/Jasleen1/winterfell 
contain the code this repo is based on, but they use winterfell[https://github.com/novifinancial/winterfell] as a 
pure dependency. This repository is meant to transition to using the winterfell crate[https://crates.io/crates/winterfell/0.4.0/dependencies].
